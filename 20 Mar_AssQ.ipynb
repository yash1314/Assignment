    "Ans - Nominal encoding is a type of encoding done on nominal categorical data. such dataset dosen't have any natural order or rank or we can say it dosen't have any relationship. We use dummy variable technique of statistics which is called One hot encoding in machine learning. Seperate columns are created for each class in categorical feature and then binary values are assigned to labels according to their occurances. \n",

We should be aware of any dependencies among the categorical data i.e order/rank, based on this information we can apply ordinal or one hot encoding.

Also if the feature is output feature i.e target feature then we can use label encoding otherwise ordinal or one hot encoding. "
