    "Ans - Multithreading refers to running multiple threads concurrently i.e at the same time. Multithreading is a way of achieving multitasking. It is achieved by frequently switiching between threads and is called context switching. This is used beacuse through mutlithreading we achieve efficient performance, good response time, efficient utilization of memory and resources. We use threading  and thread method to handle threads in python."
