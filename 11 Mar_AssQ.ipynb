    "Ans: - The t-test can be understood as a statistical test which is used to compare and analyse whether the means of the two population is different from one another. whereas, Z-test is a parametric test, which is applied when the means of the two datasets differ from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A z-test is used to test a Null Hypothesis if the population variance is known, or if the sample size is larger than 30, for an unknown population variance. Whereas a t-test is used when the sample size is less than 30 and the population variance is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is assumed that the z-statistic follows a standard normal distribution, whereas the t-statistic follows the t-distribution with a degree of freedom equal to n-1, where n is the sample size.\n",

    "- A one-tailed test may be either left-tailed or right-tailed whereas two-tail test will be on both the ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The confidence interval must remain a constant size, so if we are performing a two-tailed test, as there are twice as many critical regions then these critical regions must be half the size. This means that when we read the tables, when performing a two-tailed test, we need to consider alpha value/2 instead of alpha."

    "Ans: The margin of error is defined a the range of values below and above the sample statistic in a confidence interval.\n",
    "For example, a 95% confidence interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that our statistic will be within 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time. In more simpler terms, margin of error tells you how many percentage points your results will differ from the real population value.\n",
