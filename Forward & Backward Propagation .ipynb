    "**Ans** - Forward propagation in a neural network serves the purpose of computing the output of the network for a given input. It involves passing the input data through the network's layers, applying activation functions, and aggregating information to produce a final prediction or output. This process allows the network to generate predictions based on its current set of weights and biases, forming the foundation for subsequent steps like backpropagation during the training phase."

    "\n",
    "Weights represent the strength of connections between neurons in different layers of the network. Each connection is associated with a weight, and the value of the weight determines the impact of the input on the output. During forward propagation, the input features are multiplied by their corresponding weights, and these weighted inputs are aggregated to form a weighted sum. This process captures the importance of each input feature in influencing the network's prediction.\n",

During forward propagation, the bias is added to the weighted sum of inputs. This bias term allows the neural network to model situations where even when all input features are zero, there may be a non-zero output. It helps the network learn the correct decision boundaries."
