    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both popular statistical models used in machine learning, but they are different and are suited for different types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used for predicting continuous quantative values based on independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. The objective of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the overall distance between the predicted values and the actual values. For example, linear regression can be used to predict house prices based on factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, true/false, 0/1). It is used when the dependent variable is categorical in nature. Logistic regression model the relationship between the input variables and the probability of the binary output. It uses a sigmoid function (also known as the logistic function ) to map the input values to a probability score. For example, logistic regression can be used to predict whether a customer will buy the subscription based on past purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between linear regression and logistic regression is the type of dependent variable they deal with. Linear regression predicts continuous numeric values, while logistic regression predicts binary categorical outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An example scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression is in predicting whether a patient has a specific medical condition or not based on various medical test results and patient characteristics. The outcome is binary (presence or absence of the condition), and logistic regression can estimate the probability of the condition based on the input variables. Linear regression, on the other hand, would not be suitable in this case because it assumes a continuous dependent variable, which isn't restricted in the range of [0,1] as in the case of binary classification.

This penalty encourages the model to reduce the magnitude of all parameters simultaneously, but without eliminating any of them entirely. L2 regularization can help to reduce the impact of outliers and make the model more stable.\n",

It pushes the coefficients of less important features towards zero, effectively eliminating them from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tree-based Feature Importance: Use tree-based models to rank features based on their contribution to the model's performance. features that contribute the most to the reduction in impurity or the highest information gain are considered more important. By ranking the features based on their importance, less relevant features can be eliminated. This technique is useful when dealing with both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "These feature selection techniques help improve the model's performance in several ways. They reduce overfitting by selecting only the most relevant features, which allows the model to generalize well to new data. Feature selection enhances the interpretability of the model by focusing on the most important predictors. Moreover, it improves computational efficiency as fewer features require less time and resources for training and inference. Finally, these techniques help address the curse of dimensionality by selecting a subset of informative features, mitigating the challenges associated with high-dimensional data."
