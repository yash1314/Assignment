    "\n",
    "Elastic net regression has several advantages over lasso and ridge regression, depending on the data and the problem. For instance, it can handle multicollinearity better than lasso regression by grouping correlated features and selecting the most representative ones. Additionally, it can reduce model complexity by eliminating irrelevant features, which is more effective than ridge regression. Moreover, elastic net regression can achieve a better trade-off between bias and variance than lasso and ridge regression by tuning the regularization parameters. Furthermore, this type of regression can be applied to various types of data, such as linear, logistic, or Cox regression models.\n",

    "Disadvantages of elastic net regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic net regression has some drawbacks compared to lasso and ridge regression, such as requiring more computational resources and time due to two regularization parameters and a cross-validation process. It may not perform optimally when there is no correlation between features or when the number of features is much smaller than the number of observations, as it may lose predictive power or introduce bias. Additionally, it may not be easily interpretable, as it could select a large number of features with small coefficients or a small number of features with large coefficients."

    "The coefficients of elastic net regression represents the linear relationship between the features and the target variable, adjusted by the regularization penalty factor. The larger the absolute value of a coefficient, the stronger the effect of change of the corresponding feature on the target variable. The sign of a coefficient indicates the direction of the effect change: positive for positive correlation, negative for negative correlation. The coefficients that are zero indicate that the corresponding features are not relevant for the model, and that they are eliminated by the lasso penalty. Therefore, we can use the coefficients of elastic net regression to rank the features by their importance and select the ones that have non-zero coefficients."

    "Elastic net Regression is a combination of both Lasso and Ridge regularization. Lasso and ridge both can handle multicollinearity and overfitting but lasso has an upper hand, lasso can perfrom feature selection by shrinking the coefficients to zero. Elastic net regression has both L1 norm and L2 norm .e lambda and coefficient parameter. So when l2 norm i.e ridge regression's lambda factor is zero elastic net becomes lasso regularization and can perfrom feature selection. But we don't do this in practical instead we keep ridge regularization along with lasso and achieve a trade-off between the too to obtain the best of both fucntionality. "
