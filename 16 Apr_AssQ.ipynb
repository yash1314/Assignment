    "- **Improved Model Performance**: Increasing the number of estimators typically leads to improved model performance.

Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. This can lead to poor generalization and lower performance on unseen data.\n",
