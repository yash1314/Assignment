    "**Ans** - In the context of artificial neural networks, an activation function is a mathematical operation applied to each node (or neuron) in a neural network. It determines the output of a neuron, which is then used as input for the next layer of the network. Activation functions introduce non-linearities to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data."
