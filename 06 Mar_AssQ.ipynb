    "\n",
    "- #### Mean:\n",
    "Mean is the average of all the values in a dataset. It is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by total number values in a dataset. It gives us a numerical value that mostly describes the centre of data and it relative relations to other values in dataset. Mean is mostly affected by outliers and is therefore not as precise in terms of outliers. \n",

    "    - and the value we get corresponds to the postion of middle value. In this way we can find the middle value by median.\n",
