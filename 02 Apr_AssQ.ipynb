    "Ans: The purpose of grid search CV (Cross-Validation) in machine learning is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set before the training process. Grid search CV helps in systematically searching and evaluating different combinations of hyperparameters to identify the best set that maximizes the model's performance.\n",

    "Grid search CV systematically searches through a predefined grid of hyperparameters for a machine learning model, evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation. It trains and tests the model with different hyperparameter combinations, computes the performance metric for each combination, and selects the hyperparameters that yield the best performance. By exhaustively exploring the hyperparameter space, grid search CV automates the process of hyperparameter tuning and helps identify the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model.\n",

    "Ans: Data leakage refers to the situation where information from outside the training data unintentionally leaks into the model, leading to overly optimistic or misleading performance evaluations. It occurs when features or information that would not be available during actual deployment are included in the training process. Data leakage can arise from various sources such as including future information, data preprocessing mistakes, or using target-related information.\n",

    "Data leakage is a problem in machine learning because it can cause models to perform well during training and evaluation but fail to generalize to new unseen data. This leads to unreliable models that make inaccurate predictions when deployed in real-world scenario. Data leakage can misrepresent the true performance of a model, making it difficult to assess its true effectiveness and potentially leading to incorrect decisions and flawed outcomes. Preventing data leakage is crucial for building robust and reliable machine learning models.\n",
