Rather than relying on a single model, ensemble techniques leverage the collective knowledge of multiple models to make more accurate predictions.\n",

    "Ans: Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique in machine learning that involves creating multiple models by training them on different subsets of the original training data. Each model is trained independently and produces its own predictions. The final prediction is obtained by combining the predictions of all the models, usually through averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification).\n",

    "The main idea behind bagging is to reduce variance and improve predictive performance by leveraging the diversity of the models. By training on different subsets of the data, the models capture different aspects of the underlying patterns and noise in the data. Combining their predictions helps to create a more robust and accurate overall prediction, as the models compensate for each other's weaknesses and reduce the impact of outliers or noisy data points. Bagging is widely used, and Random Forest is a popular algorithm that utilizes the bagging technique."

    "ANs: Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning that iteratively builds a strong model by combining multiple weak models. In each iteration, the weak model is trained to focus on the misclassified instances from the previous models. The final prediction is obtained by combining the weighted predictions of all the weak models. Boosting aims to improve prediction accuracy by sequentially correcting the mistakes made by previous models and emphasizing difficult-to-predict instances. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and AdaBoost are popular boosting algorithms."

For example, if you want a 95% confidence interval, you would use the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.\n",

The BCa method provides better results when the distribution of the statistic is skewed or when the sample size is small.\n",
