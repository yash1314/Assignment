    "Ans: R-squared is often interpreted as the percentage of variance in the target variable explained by the model. For example, an R-squared value of 0.80 implies that 80% of the variability in the target variable is accounted for by the predictors in the model. Higher R-squared values indicate a better fit and a greater ability of the model to explain the variance in the target variable. Therefore we can use RMSE as evaluation metric."
